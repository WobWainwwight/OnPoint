componentDidMount() is used for getting external data like from dbs

added the main css back in

issue- style is not loading - issue wasn't resolved, have to use import "<path to css file>" 
Not necessarily a bad thing

working on image upload for article creation, React first, then backend
will give good idea of how backend works

Lots of different backend to use... Will be using node.js/express decision made, get on with it

Left article creation for now to have a go at login, will be easier to learn backend this way

With fetch(), post requests take in two paramaters, a url and an object that you're posting

Almost there
